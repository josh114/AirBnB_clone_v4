# AirBnB Clone: Phase # 3

: API

## Description

Project attempts to clone the the AirBnB application and website, including the
database, storage, RESTful API, Web Framework, and Front End.  Currently the
application is designed to run with 2 storage engine models:

* File Storage Engine:

  * `/models/engine/file_storage.py`

* Database Storage Engine:

  * `/models/engine/db_storage.py`

  * To Setup the DataBase for testing and development, there are 2 setup
  scripts that setup a database with certain privileges: `setup_mysql_test.sql`
  & `setup_mysql_test.sql` (for more on setup, see below).

  * The Database uses Environmental Variables for tests.  To execute tests with
  the environmental variables prepend these declarations to the execution
  command:

```
